# React Product Filter
 How to implement filter in ReactJS to only display specific products out of varieties of products

 A filter, as the name suggests, is a function that is being used on most websites to sort out specific user preferences. You must have used a filter on an e-commerce website when shopping for a specific product out of the multitude of similar products. The way filter is implemented on many websites is different. On some websites, you can search for a product and then you get the filtered results. On some other websites, you can hit a button for a particular product and you will only get a variety of that product.

 This project is a beginner's guide on how to implement filter (a JavaScript array method) in ReactJS. The way it works is that when the button for a particular laptop brand (which can be any product) is clicked or tapped, only the available products of that laptop brand will be displayed out of all the available laptop brands.
